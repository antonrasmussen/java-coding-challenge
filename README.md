# java-coding-challenge

This is a small Java coding challenge that we normally ask all candidates to complete in order to help us better assess their coding abilities. The challenge is designed to hopefully not take more than 1-2 hours of your time. The challenge is also designed to be aligned with the [Clinical Trials Reporting Program](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccct/ctrp) project at [CBIIT](https://github.com/CBIIT), on which you most likely will be working on.
